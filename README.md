# CheckJavaProgram
Description:
 Using an appropriate data structure write a program that makes sure a JAVA programâ€™s grouping symbols match correctly. These are symbols like parentheses ( ), curly braces { },  Angle brackets < >, and Brackets [ ]. 
 
 For example, your program should print an error message (about an incorrect match) if your java source file contains the following class definition:
 
 class Wheel {  
 public void inflate(int psi {  
 System.out.println("Inflating to " + psi + "psi");   
 } 
 } 
 
 Use command like arguments to read the JAVA source-code file
